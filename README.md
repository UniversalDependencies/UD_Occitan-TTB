# Summary
Tolosa Treebank was developed as part of the EFA 227/16 LINGUATEC Project, financed by the POCTEFA Interreg European funds.
It includes data from literature, newspapers, encyclopedia, scientific papers and web blogs.

# Introduction

The current version of the treebank contains 25K tokens annotated for PoS tags, lemmas and syntactic dependencies. Four major dialects are represented: Lengadocian, Gascon, Lemosin and Provençau. Note, however, that the data is heavily skewed towards Lengadocian.
